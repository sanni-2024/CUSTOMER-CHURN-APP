#     CUSTOMER-CHURN-APP
The goal of this project is to deploy an application for a classification model. I chose to use the Random Forest and Gradient Descent models, which are embedded in a pipeline.

The models (Random Forest and Gradient Descent) are located in the "Models" folder, while the source code is available in the "Pages" folder and the Home.py file. The required CSV files can be found in the "Datasets" folder.
pip install -r requirements.txt Usage import all the necessary library names. eg import Gradio as gr Contributing Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. Contact me via my email: sanniyssif23@gmail.com  Article Link: EMBEDDING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ON STREAMLIT | by Issifu sanni | Sep, 2024 | Medium
